 My website for a wristwatch: minimalist design, BEM methodology, interactive with JavaScript, fluid adaptive layout using SCSS, and subtle CSS/SVG animations for an engaging user experience. The site also incorporates a sophisticated Swiper slider, enhancing navigation and showcasing watch collections seamlessly.
